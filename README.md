# Excel-Project-for-Store-Analysis
This is a portfolio project for learning Excel, where I have analyzed an E-Commerce Store Data
Data File:- Store Data.xlsx

Data Analysis:- Store Data Analysis.xlsx

The Store owner wants to create an Annual Sales Report for the FY 2022, to attract new Investors. Also, they want to explore more options for increasing sales in the coming FY 2023.

The skills I learned while completing this Project are:
*Data Cleaning
*Data Processing
*Data Analysis
*Data Visualization

Data Cleaning:- To check whether the data is correct or not. Whether it has any inconsistencies, blanks, spelling errors, extra spaces, or any other error.

Data Processing:- Depending on the Questions we have to answer, we need to arrange the data in some specific format, so Data Processing is done.

Data Analysis:- Creation of Pivot Tables and solving the questions are done in this section.

Data Visualization:- Creating Charts or Pie-Diagrams to create a full-fledged report is done in Data Visualization.

Questions to Answer:-
1. Compare the sales and orders using a single chart
2. Which month got the highest sales and orders
3. Who purchased more - Men or Women
4. What is the Delivered Order Percentage?
5. List the Top 10 States contributing to the Sales
6. Relation between Age and Gender-based on Sales
7. Which Channel is contributing to Maximum Sales
8. Highest Selling Category?

Insights after the Report:-
*Women are likely to buy more compared to men:- 65%
*Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 States with maximum Sale
*Adult Age Group(Age:30-49Years) is maximum contributor to the Sales
*Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra channels are the maximum contributors(80%)

Final Conclusion:- Target Women Customers of the age group 30-49 Years living in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh by offering them ads\offers/discount coupons available on Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra
